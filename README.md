Kieter's Submission is made in collaboration with:

I changed these Gutenberg books because I read them in high school:
* http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-h/1342-h.htm
* http://www.gutenberg.org/files/58915/58915-h/58915-h.htm
* http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1400/1400-h/1400-h.htm

Changes Kieter made to the Gutenberg CSS include:
* Changing the font family 
* Changing the font sizes to a more legible size
* Changed the background to a nice soft yellow
* Centered a lot of the content
* Links have a sweet soft animation when you hover over them
* Image captions are italicized and in a smaller font
* Smooth drop shadow on images
